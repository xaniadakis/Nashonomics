# Nashonomics

**Nashonomics** is a curated collection of analytical solutions developed as part of the *Algorithmic Game Theory* course in the Data Science & Machine Learning program at the National Technical University of Athens. The repository showcases three in-depth assignments, each designed to build a foundational understanding of how rational agents interact in competitive and cooperative environments.

The first assignment focuses on truthful mechanism design, particularly the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) framework. Through rigorous proofs and algorithmic examples, we explored how payments can be structured to elicit honest behavior in settings involving public projects and optimization over combinatorial domains.

The second assignment turns to the economic theory of auctions, diving into Myerson’s Lemma and its implications for optimal revenue in single-parameter agent environments. Additional topics include project selection with budget constraints and the allocation of goods under uncertainty, balancing individual incentives with social efficiency.

In the third assignment we examine routing games and congestion models, analyze the inefficiencies that arise when individuals act selfishly—quantified by the Price of Anarchy, and explore how system-level performance can be improved through toll mechanisms, Nash equilibria and coordination strategies.

Across all three assignments, the emphasis lies in combining mathematical precision with intuitive reasoning to understand the incentives, trade-offs and equilibria that underpin algorithmic decision-making. Each solution is presented in PDF form, carefully written to reflect both the theoretical rigor and real-world relevance of algorithmic game theory.
